# Silent Failure in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers where asynchronous operation errors are silently swallowed, leading to unexpected behavior and a lack of feedback to the client.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The server uses promises to handle an asynchronous operation. However, it lacks proper error handling in the `.catch` block.  If the asynchronous operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the client receives no indication of the failure. This results in a seemingly unresponsive server.

## Solution

The solution involves sending an appropriate error response to the client when the asynchronous operation fails.  This informs the client of the problem and prevents confusion.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the buggy behavior.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.
